          Hi, I'm <strong>Kehinde Imani</strong>, a skilled <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>, 
          <strong>Virtual Assistant</strong>, and <strong>Mathematics Educator</strong>.  
        </p>
    
        <p>
          With a background in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>, my journey into tech was fueled by a deep passion 
          for creativity, problem-solving, and bringing ideas to life through code.  
          Despite my engineering roots, I found my true calling in Frontend Development, 
          where I get to blend design, logic, and user experience to create interactive, high-performance web applications.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Today, I specialize in building <strong>modern, responsive, and visually appealing websites</strong> using 
          <strong>React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>.  
          I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and ensuring seamless user experiences that engage and convert visitors into customers.  
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Beyond development, my experience as a Virtual Assistant allows me to bring structure, efficiency, 
          and organization to businessesâ€”handling <strong>data entry, social media management, email handling, and more</strong>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Whether you need a stunning website, an efficient virtual assistant, or a reliable problem-solver,  
          I am the professional you can count on! Let's collaborate and bring your vision to reality.
